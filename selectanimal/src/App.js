            The Aldabra Giant Tortoise is a massive, long-necked reptile endemic
            to the Aldabra Islands off the East Coast of Africa. The Aldabra
            giant tortoise is among the biggest types of land tortoise and
            longest-living animals on the planet, with one Aldabra Giant
            Tortoise living to the impressive age of 255 years old. The Aldabra
            Giant Tortoise is the last living species of Indian ocean giant
            Tortoise species alive today as others such as the Seychelles Giant
            Tortoise fell extinct soon after the arrival of humans to this
            region. The Aldabra Giant Tortoise and the Seychelles Giant Tortoise
            share many characteristics, to the point where much debate has
            arisen as to their true classification.

            Arctic foxes (often misspelled as artic fox or artic foxes) are
            small, adorable animals and have natural adaptations protecting them
            from predators and frigid temperatures. According to fossils, Arctic
            foxes got their start in Tibet during the Pliocene Epoch, 2.6
            million years ago, then spread to North America and Eurasia by
            migrating over ice-land bridges. The species is Icelandâ€™s only
            native mammal, and while hundreds of thousands currently roam around
            the Arctic Circle, climate change threatens to decimate populations
            in the coming years.
